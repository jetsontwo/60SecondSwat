For my game, I wanted the player to feel a sense of excitement and anxiety to try and
reach the end and destroy the bomb. Ideally, the game would not be beat the first time
as the player learns the mechanics of the game and gets used to the control but after 
failing the first time the player would want to try again. On the second playthrough, the player would be able to get through it much faster and beat the game, feeling pride
from learning the controls of the game and mastering it's content.

To play, a player has to transfer the .apk game file onto their phone by plugging it into their laptop. The phone must be in developer mode (pressing the build number in the about tab in the settings several time) and then going into the developer settings and turning on USB debugging. Once the packet is transferred the game can be installed. To Install, a user must go into their phones file system and click on the build1.apk file, this will install the game onto the system and it will be ready to play. A player can move left and right with the associated buttons then they can jump and shoot. Using these controls the player must advance all the way to the right and destroy the bomb by shooting it before it explodes.
